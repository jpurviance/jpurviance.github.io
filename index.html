      <h3>About The Developer</h3>
      <p>Hello, I'm John and welcome to my page! I am a Computer Science, Math and Economics student at Virginia Tech. While I'm not in class, I spend my time Rock Climbing, Coding and Working as Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in an introductory class on Floral Design.</p>

      <h3>Personal Projects:</h3>

      <h4>Flex: Microsoft API Winner at VT Hacks III</h4>
      <p><a href="http://devpost.com/software/flex">Flex</a> is a budgeting app developed on top of Capital One’s APIs that is designed to help users have a comprehensive understanding of their spending patterns. We were not happy with the bank statements that our banks were providing us at the end of each month, our online accounts were not providing much more information. Flex is not another bank statement; it was designed to be your new personal advisor.</p>
      <p>Humans do not associate purchases with company codes or merchant acronyms. We associate purchases with locations and experiences. It was very important to us to develop an application that understands this and presents users location-based transaction information. I worked extensively with another team member to bring past purchases to a web map powered by OpenStreetMap and Leaflet JS. Bank account users should understand where they are spending.</p>
      <p>The personalized data visualizations are powered by taking user purchase and breaking them into sub-categories through Natural Language Processing. User experience and page responsiveness was very important to us. Much of our analysis was run in batches and cached to provide the best user experience possible.</p>
      <h5>Contributions:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Stood up Python Flask server for serving out processed data from Capital One APIs.</li>
        <li>Developed RESTful API for accessing preprocessed, cached values for improved user experience.</li>
        <li>Integrated OpenStreetMap and Leaflet JS to give users a visual understanding of purchasing patterns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Hardware Simulation and Algorithm Analysis</h4>
      <p>Recently I have been working on a hardware cache simulation project in Java during my free time. The application implements three types of hardware caches; Direct Map, Set Associative and Full Associative cache architectures. The application is designed to help users understand how algorithms can be optimized to prevent costly reads and writes from system RAM. Currently, Bubble, Heap, Insertion, and Quicksort algorithms are implemented. More information about the project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/jpurviance/Hardware-Cache-Simulation-and-Algorithm-Evaluation">GitHub</a> page.</p>

      <h4>Personal Website</h4>
      <p>This page originated as an assignment for CS 3604: Professionalism in Computing at Virginia Tech. It has evolved into a place where I can experiment with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I look to continue to grow it and use it as a place to become more experienced with web technologies.</p>
