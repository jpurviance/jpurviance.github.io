      <hr id="name_hr">
      <p>Hello, I'm John and welcome to my page! I am a Computer Science, Math and Economics student at Virginia Tech. While I'm not in class, I spend my time Rock Climbing, Coding and working as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in VT's Intro to GUI. In the past, I have taught classes on Floral Design. <a href="mailto:jpurviance@vt.edu">Contact Me</a> or view my <a href=/files/john_purviance_public.pdf>Resume</a></p>

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I have a strong interest in the intersection of Computer Science, Behavioral Economics, and UI Design. I have experience with how aesthetics and choice architecture influence users. While working on Flex, a Web Application that won the Microsoft API award at VT Hacks III, my team and I worked hard to integrate mechanisms from behavioral economics to encourage users to make better financial decisions. Behavioral economics is the study of how the availability of information along with social, environmental and emotional circumstances determine decisions. We leveraged color theory to increase engagement and boost memory retention. I also developed the backend for the application.</p>
    <p>I am actively working to improve my proficiency in Algorithmic and Behavioral Economics. During my Junior year at Virginia Tech, I had the opportunity to complete the Senior Game Theory course in the Economics Department. This fall I am leveraging my education in Game Theory by taking Artificial Intelligence. I am also bolstering my understanding of Algorithms by taking Algorithm Analysis and participating in the Virginia Tech Programing teams practices. In my free time this semester I am working as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for the CS departments introduction to GUI.</p>

      <p class="flex-info"><a href="http://devpost.com/software/flex">Flex</a> is a budgeting app developed on top of Capital One’s APIs that is designed to help users have a comprehensive understanding of their spending patterns. We were not happy with the bank statements that our banks were providing us at the end of each month, our online accounts were not providing much more information. Flex is not another bank statement; it was designed to be your new personal advisor.

    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 center">
      <p class="flex-info">Humans do not associate purchases with company codes or merchant acronyms. We associate purchases with locations and experiences. It was very important to us to develop an application that understands this and presents users with location-based transaction information. I worked extensively with another team member to bring past purchases to a web map powered by OpenStreetMap and Leaflet JS. Bank account users should understand where they are spending.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4">
      <p class="flex-info">The personalized data visualizations are powered by taking user purchases and breaking them into sub-categories through Natural Language Processing. User experience and page responsiveness was very important to us. Much of our analysis was run in batches and cached to provide the best user experience possible.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/salim-memon/CafeConnect">Cafe Connect</a> is not a iOS app or a WebApp but instead a conversation starter. Cafe Connect was built to remove the need for automated phone operators and to provide customers a mechanism to help initiate personal conversations and resolve banking problems. <a href="https://salim-memon.github.io/CafeConnect/">Brand Site</a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 ">
      <p class="cafe-info">A team of interns including myself developed this tool to facilitate customer engagement at Capital One’s 2016 Carbon intern hackathon. Users of CafeConnect have the opportunity to order a coffee and request a Capital One Bank ambassador for personalized help with Capital One's products. Customers meet the advisor before a word is even said through sophisticated in-app matching.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 center">
      <p class="cafe-info">Built upon the power of Node.JS, Express.JS, Angular.JS, MongoDB and iOS to deliver a cohesive experience for customers with a platform independent application for ambassadors. The customers facing iOS app interfaces with the Node.JS REST API that I built. The internal WebApp works on any device with a modern browser and allows specialists to view and select customers from the queue to offer a personal experience to each visitor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4">
      <p class="cafe-info">Cafe Connect won best Mobile or WebApp for its ease of use, aesthetics, and platform independence while strengthening customer relationships with ambassadors. Our application eliminated the confusion associated with managing appointments in such a casual environment. Users get the help they need, at the time they need it, while being a part of a real conversation.</p>

      <p>Recently I have been working on a hardware cache simulation project in Java during my free time. The application implements three types of hardware caches; Direct Map, Set Associative, and Full Associative cache architectures. The application is designed to help users understand how algorithms can be optimized to prevent costly reads and writes from system RAM. Currently, Bubble, Heap, Insertion, and Quicksort algorithms are implemented. More information about the project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/jpurviance/Hardware-Cache-Simulation-and-Algorithm-Evaluation">GitHub</a> page.</p>
